# v 0.0.1

- The main functionality is implemented, currently there are issues with the helmet view obscuring after flattening as well as large scraps blocking the view. The former can be solved by installing **FOV_Adjust** **v1.1.1** **by Rozebud** or by turning on **Hide Visor** in this mod (only works for you), the latter is currently unknown.
  主体功能实现，目前有变扁后头盔视野遮挡的问题以及垃圾挡视野的问题。前者可以安装**FOV_Adjust** **v1.1.1** **by Rozebud** 或 在本模组中打开 **隐藏面罩遮挡** （仅对自己有效），后者目前不知道如何解决。
